## Deploy:
`npm run start`

## Task:
Create a component that effectively renders a large list of items (e.g. 10,000 elements) with the
assumption that all items in the list are the same size.

Support items of different sizes and render additional elements above and below the visible
elements, so theyâ€™ll already be visible when they scroll into view.

Provide a working repository with this component built on top of create-react-app with typescript
template.

Please do not use any 3rd party components.
